will solve for all unknowns (R,P,I,E) for every single resistance and also totals, works with any # number of resistances in parallel and series (no combination), output will be a csv file
requires for floating point calcultations: https://cmdlinecalc.sourceforge.io/

**very simple script will do some error checking at end
